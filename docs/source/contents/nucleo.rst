Nucleo boards are a series of **development boards** designed by `STMicroelectronics <https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html>`_. They are specifically tailored for **rapid prototyping** and **easy development** of microcontroller-based projects. 

Nucleo boards typically feature an **STM32** microcontroller unit (MCU) as their core component, which belongs to the ARM® Cortex-M® family.

These boards offer a variety of features such as on-board debugging and programming interfaces, multiple :abbr:`GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output` pins, integrated sensors, connectivity options, as well as expansion headers for **connecting additional hardware modules**.

Nucleo boards are popular among hobbyists, students, and professional developers due to their affordability, versatility, and ease of use. Different **integrated development environment (IDE)** support could be used to develop program for **STM32** MCU: 

* `STM32CubeMX / STM32CubeIDE <https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/stm32cube.html>`_
* Keil µVision
* `MBED Studio <https://os.mbed.com/studio/>`_ / `Keil Studio Cloud <https://www.keil.arm.com/>`_


Nucleo boards serve as a **convenient platform** for learning embedded systems programming, experimenting with various sensors and peripherals, and prototyping IoT (Internet of Things) applications.
